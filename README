Killdeer is a simple server for replaying a sample of responses to
sythentically recreate production response characteristics.

The response-sample.txt represents a response per line. Each request made to
killdeer replays the responses in the sample file. When it reaches the end it
loops back to the beginning. The file's format is currently not configurable.
The columns represent the following:
